# Heroes & Villains

## Description

My website is set on the theme of superheroes and villains of all time, it is a search engine for these words.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- __Dashboard:__ Main page with a wallpaper, a brief explanation and a carousel where photos of the different characters appear.
- __Browser:__ Page where all the characters are and there is a search bar where the heroes or hero you are looking for appear.
- __Sign Up:__ User registration page where you ask for name (supername), favorite character, email, password and repeat password.
- __Log in:__ Page where you ask for email and password.

## Backlog

Create a page with all the universes (Marvel, DC, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.) and click on one to redirect it to another page where all the characters of that universe and their details are.
